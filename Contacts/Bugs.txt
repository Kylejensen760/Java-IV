////////////Bugs////////////////
If you select a contact and then sort the list of contacts,
	the displayed contact will be incorrect.
	Also, clicking on a contact in a sorted list will only
	display the contact originally in that location.

If you press the "add" button and then select a contact (or, assumedly, do anything to 'overlap' the current panel on the right, 
	you cannot bring it up again by clicking the button, effectively rendering the button useless.
	This doesn't apply to the list of contacts, but notably, clicking an 
	already selected contact after selecting a button will not bring up the contact's page again.

		This MIGHT be able to help:	http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18132212/readding-removed-panel-in-jframe
		Though it just seems to be telling us what we're already doing: deleting whatever's currently in the LINE_END / EAST section,
		adding the desired panel, and then revalidating the main panel.

		Added 'mainPanel.repaint();' after main panel revalidation, and it had a weird effect. Didn't seem to fix it, but it did... something.

	ALSO:
	Panels aren't actually going away, you can still hover over the area a textField used to exist from another panel, click there, and you can type.
	Buttons will also appear if you hover over them.
